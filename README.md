ChatGPT said:  Massive MIMO in 5G uses many antennas to serve multiple users simultaneously. With perfect Channel State Information (CSI), it achieves optimal beamforming, high spectral and energy efficiency, reduced interference, and scalable capacity. Perfect CSI shows the ideal performance limit of 5G networks
